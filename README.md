# Startly Project

## Overview
Startly is a project where I cloned a website available on ThemeForest. The primary technologies used for this project are HTML5 and Tailwind CSS, which allowed me to create a visually appealing layout and design.

## Description
This repository contains a complete clone of a theme that showcases various features and layouts. My aim was to enhance my skills in web development while working with Tailwind's utility-first CSS framework.

## Key Features
- Full website clone using HTML5 for structure and Tailwind CSS for styling
- Clean and modern design inspired by a ThemeForest template
- Demonstrates the use of Tailwind classes to create responsive and attractive components

## Limitations
- The site may not include all functionalities of the original ThemeForest template.
- While I aimed for responsiveness, some elements may not adapt perfectly across all devices.
- The project serves mainly as a practice exercise rather than a fully optimized product.

## Conclusion
The Startly project has been a valuable experience in learning how to implement web design with HTML5 and Tailwind CSS. It has deepened my understanding of modern web development practices, and I look forward to applying these skills to future projects!
